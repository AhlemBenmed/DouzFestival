            <p><b> The Ksar Ghilane hot spring </b> is a very important asset of the region.</p>

<p>Water has always been the source of life! Imagine then in the desert! where the climate is arid, and where temperatures exceed 50%.</p>

<p>In the middle of the sand dunes that stretch as far as the eye can see, life can also exist… A natural hot spring is found in Ksar Ghilane and has been used to create an oasis in the middle of nowhere!</p>

<p>This source of water springs all year round… It is used for entertainment for swimming but above all for irrigation of the oases created around…</p>

<p>Thanks to this source, now Ksar Ghilane is no longer a desert but an oasis where the greenery of the palm trees embraces the ocher color of the dunes…</p>

<p>This source has allowed the inhabitants to live off the date palms and fruit trees they plant, but it is also used for tourism.</p>

<p>No one can visit Ksar Ghilane without taking advantage of its sulfur-rich natural hot spring!</p>

<p>Next to the spring, the café has set up a space for changing clothes. The only problem is that the source is located between cafes and shops, which is not practical for modest people!</p>

<p>During their visits to the oasis people generally enjoy a quad or camel ride in the dunes. This means that they come back covered in sand and this is where swimming at the source becomes a real pleasure!</p>
